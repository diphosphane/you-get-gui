# you-get-gui
A GUI made for you-get, which you can use to download video from youtube, biliblili and etc. 

Currently it's an early stage app. The GUI may freeze at UI, and can not show progress in GUI (but can show progress in command line), if the app is stuck, just wait, it is just searching or downloading, At later I'll fix these problem.
